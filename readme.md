# ToDoList App

Following the studies on backend technologies I was able to develop this project, wich was proposed by @angelabauer on the course of hers that I'm taking.

This is a simple todo list, with functionalities of adding new items on the list and then remove them by clicking on the wished one.

It was made with Node, EJS and MongoDB and deployed on Heroku for checking results of the developing study.

It is possible to check it out on the link: https://powerful-dawn-53780.herokuapp.com/
